# Tasks

Below is a sequential list of all tasks required to go from an empty project directory to a complete product. Each task is bite-sized with clear acceptance criteria that can be verified (often by running commands or tests). The development will pause after each task for review before proceeding.

## AI Agent Configuration

- [ ]  **Create AGENTS.md**: Create a new `docs/AGENTS.md` file with instructions for the Claude AI agent. Include references to the Product Requirements Document (`docs/PRD.md`) and the Design document (`docs/Design.md`). Also outline that the agent should take the next incomplete task from `docs/Tasks.md`, implement it, then pause for human verification before continuing.
    
    **Acceptance Criteria:**
    
    - `docs/AGENTS.md` exists and contains references to `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/Design.md`.
    - The content explains the agent’s workflow (sequentially executing tasks from the task list and pausing for review).
    - (Verification: Opening `docs/AGENTS.md` shows the expected instructions, including the PRD/Design paths and task execution guidelines.)
- [ ]  **Symlink CLAUDE.md to AGENTS.md**: Create a symlink `CLAUDE.md` in the project root that points to `docs/AGENTS.md`. This ensures Claude Code reads the agent instructions.
    
    **Acceptance Criteria:**
    
    - A file `CLAUDE.md` exists in the root and is a symlink to `docs/AGENTS.md`.
    - `readlink CLAUDE.md` outputs `docs/AGENTS.md`, confirming the symlink target.
    - Opening `CLAUDE.md` shows the same content as `docs/AGENTS.md` (verifying the link is correct).

# bombay – AI Agent Execution Guide

This repo uses an AI coding agent (e.g., Claude Code). The agent must:

1) Read docs/Tasks.md and take the next unchecked task only.
2) Use docs/PRD.md and docs/Design.md as the source of truth.
3) Implement exactly what the task asks; do not bundle tasks.
4) Verify the task’s acceptance criteria, commit, push, and stop.
5) Wait for the human operator to check the box in Tasks.md before proceeding.

## Guardrails
- Never commit secrets. Only read env names from docs/ENV.md.
- Do not change `data-testid` values or brand token keys.
- Follow API contracts in docs/API.md and DB schema in docs/Database.md.
- For HTTP errors, use the error envelope in docs/API.md.
- Provider calls are server-side only; never expose API keys to the browser.

## Development context
- UI structure & selectors: docs/ui/structure.md, docs/ui/selectors.md.
- Brand rules: docs/brand.md and docs/ui/tokens.json.

**Reporting write restriction and proposed patches**

I’m noting that I can’t modify files due to a read-only environment enforced by an approval policy. Since I can’t apply changes, I’ll summarize the attempted updates, highlight that `docs/CHANGELOG.md` is missing but would be created with a one-line entry referencing `docs/AGENTS.md`, confirm that `docs/AGENTS.md` meets requirements with references to PRD and Design docs, and provide patch snippets for the changes so the user can apply them manually once write access is available.

**Preparing final response with patches**

I'll explain that file writes are blocked, so I'll share exact patches for `docs/Tasks.md` and a new `docs/CHANGELOG.md` file to apply when possible. I'll reference verified lines in `docs/AGENTS.md` and include the proposed diffs clearly with instructions on staging after manual application.
[2025-10-11T08:21:34] codex

Write access is blocked (read-only sandbox with approval_policy=never), so the updates couldn’t be saved or staged. I verified Task 1 is already satisfied (`docs/AGENTS.md:5-9`). Apply these patches once writes are allowed:
