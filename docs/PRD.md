# Product Requirements Document

---

---

## **üìÑ Overview**

This document outlines the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** for a web-based chat app that allows users to converse with AI models and **seamlessly switch between different AI providers** mid-conversation ‚Äî starting with **OpenAI** and **Anthropic**.

The goal: demonstrate that conversation context can continue smoothly across model or provider switches.

---

## **üéØ Objectives and Goals**

- **Seamless Model Switching:** Continue a chat even after changing providers/models.
- **Core Chat Experience:** A familiar, simple chat UI (like ChatGPT).
- **Persistent Conversations:** Multiple saved threads in a left sidebar.
- **Google Sign-In:** Easy authentication and per-user data.
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Start with OpenAI + Anthropic, exact model selection (OpenAI: GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini; Anthropic: Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Claude 3.5 Haiku).

---

## **üë§ User Stories**

- **US1:** *Sign in with Google* to securely access personal chats.
- **US2:** *Start new chat threads* for separate topics.
- **US3:** *Chat with AI* using a conversational interface.
- **US4:** *Switch providers/models mid-chat* without losing context.
- **US5:** *See saved threads* in a sidebar for continuity.
- **US6:** *Pick exact models* (e.g., GPT-4o vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for control and comparison.

---

## **‚öôÔ∏è Core Features**

### **üîê User Authentication**

- Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0) for login/logout.
- Each user‚Äôs data tied to their Google ID.
- Minimal account management (no password system).

---

### **üí¨ Chat Interface**

- Two-pane layout:
    - **Left Sidebar:** Thread list + ‚ÄúNew Chat‚Äù button.
    - **Main Panel:** Active chat conversation.
- User/Assistant message bubbles with timestamps.
- Streaming optional (okay to return full message for MVP).
- Basic Markdown rendering (line breaks, code blocks, lists).
- Typing/loading indicator while waiting for model response.

---

### **üóÇÔ∏è Conversation Threads**

- ‚ÄúNew Chat‚Äù ‚Üí fresh empty thread with new ID.
- Sidebar shows saved threads (auto-titled from first user message).
- Click thread to reload full history and continue.
- **Persistent Storage:** All messages saved in a database.
- Optional (future): rename or delete threads.

---

### **üß© Multi-Provider Model Support**

- Integrate **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and **Anthropic** (Claude 2.x).
- Dropdown or selector to choose model/provider.
- Default to most recent or GPT-4 on new chats.
- **Switch mid-conversation:**
    - User selects new model; subsequent responses come from that provider.
    - Context preserved by resending full conversation history (messages[]).
- **Optional future enhancement:** ask previous model to generate a concise *handoff summary* when switching providers.

---

### **üß† Context Management**

- Backend maintains canonical messages[] array for each thread.
- On provider switch, new model gets the same message array.
- If token limits exceeded: truncate oldest turns (MVP) or later use summarization.

---

### **üßæ Persistent Storage**

- Store users, conversations, and messages (user_id, role, content, model, timestamps).
- Persist context per user so conversations survive logout/browser close.
- Isolate contexts: no cross-thread or cross-user bleed-through.

---

### **üß≠ UI Indicators**

- Display current model/provider (e.g., ‚ÄúModel: GPT-4‚Äù).
- Provide dropdown to switch providers.
- Optional inline note like ‚ÄúSwitched to Claude 2.1‚Äù.
- Graceful error messages on API or auth failures.

---

### **üîí Security and Privacy**

- HTTPS for all client‚Äìserver communication.
- Keep API keys server-side (never exposed to browser).
- Verify Google tokens backend-side.
- Store messages safely; encrypt keys/configs.
- Add basic warning: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt share sensitive data.‚Äù

---

### **‚ö° Performance and Limits**

- Aim for 1‚Äì5 s average response latency.
- Backend enforces basic per-user rate limits.
- Handle context window limits (truncate oldest messages).
- Log usage (tokens, latency, provider).
- MVP may share one API key; monitor usage carefully.

---

## **üö´ Out of Scope (for MVP)**

- User-provided API keys (BYOK).
- Additional providers beyond OpenAI + Anthropic.
- Advanced tuning (temperature, etc.).
- Non-text modalities (image, voice).
- Collaboration or group chats.
- Heavy UI polish or animations.

---

## **üöÄ Future Enhancements**

- **BYOK** ‚Äî users supply their own API keys.
- **More Providers** ‚Äî Google Gemini, Mistral, Meta, local models.
- **Advanced Memory** ‚Äî auto-summarization or vector embeddings for long chats.
- **UI Improvements** ‚Äî rename/delete threads, dark mode, comparison mode (side-by-side answers).
- **Mobile PWA Support** ‚Äî installable and synced.
- **Usage Analytics** ‚Äî token cost tracking, provider comparison.
- **Monetization** ‚Äî free tier vs. paid premium models.

---

## **‚ùì Assumptions & Open Questions**

- Confirm Anthropic API key access + limits.
- Finalize exact model list (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude 2).
- Decide context cutoff threshold.
- Add backend quota guardrails.
- Verify conversation switching with long histories.

---

## **‚úÖ Success Criteria**

For MVP to be ‚Äúdone,‚Äù the following must hold:

- Google Sign-In works; each user sees their threads.
- Multiple threads persist between sessions.
- Switching models mid-thread preserves context; new model answers coherently.
- Errors handled gracefully; no exposed secrets.
- Demo clearly shows one conversation answered by different models sequentially.

---

## **üß≠ Future Vision (Beyond MVP)**

> ‚ÄúOne conversation, any brain.‚Äù
> 

> 
> 

> A unified chat interface where users can continue a conversation seamlessly across multiple AI models ‚Äî OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek ‚Äî and choose the right model for the moment.
