# Task Completion Log

## Task: Audit and further breakdown Tasks.md

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished:

1. **Restructured Tasks.md with phase-based approach**
   - Created "Next 20 Tasks — Working Demo Track" section based on senior engineering feedback
   - Organized tasks into 4 clear phases with client verification at each step:
     - Phase 1: Foundation and Authentication (Tasks 1-6)
     - Phase 2: Core Chat Functionality with OpenAI (Tasks 7-11) 
     - Phase 3: Multi-Provider Support and Model Switching (Tasks 12-17)
     - Phase 4: Testing and Polish (Tasks 18-20)

2. **Removed inconsistencies and duplicates**
   - Removed duplicate "Environment Templates" task
   - Removed outdated "Feature Implementation — Tasks API" section (inconsistent with Next.js chat app)
   - Consolidated completed foundation tasks into reference section
   - Cleaned up redundant and old task content

3. **Enhanced task quality**
   - Added clear **Client Verification** criteria for each task
   - Made acceptance criteria more specific and testable
   - Ensured tasks align with PRD.md, Design.md, API.md, Database.md, and Providers.md
   - Added missing critical tasks (authentication setup, database seeding, provider-specific logic, context truncation, error handling)

4. **Improved task ordering**
   - Prioritized getting a single, end-to-end flow working first
   - Each phase delivers tangible, verifiable functionality
   - Dependencies clearly structured (auth before API integration, OpenAI before Anthropic, etc.)

### Key improvements based on senior engineering feedback:

- **Missing components addressed:** NextAuth.js setup, database seeding, provider-specific adapters, context truncation, API error handling
- **Granular breakdown:** Large tasks like "Replace Mocks with Real API Integration" were broken into specific, manageable steps
- **Clear verification:** Each task includes specific client verification criteria
- **Iterative progress:** Each phase builds upon the previous one with clear deliverables

### Verification:
- ✅ Next 20 tasks present as dedicated section near the top
- ✅ Each task has clear, testable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Duplicate "Environment Templates" task removed
- ✅ "Feature Implementation — Tasks API" section removed
- ✅ Tasks aligned with PRD.md and Design.md requirements
- ✅ Phase-based structure enables incremental client verification

### Next Task:
The first active task is now **Task 1: Setup local PostgreSQL using Docker** from Phase 1.

## Task: Setup local PostgreSQL using Docker

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Verified docker-compose.yml defines a PostgreSQL 15 service with healthcheck and persistent volume.
- Confirmed presence of .env.docker.example and used a local .env.docker (git-ignored) with:
  - POSTGRES_DB=bombay_dev
  - POSTGRES_USER=bombay
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=•••••••• (local dev only)
- Ensured .env.example includes a local Docker DATABASE_URL and docs/DEV.md documents Docker workflow.
- Brought the database up and confirmed health via Docker.
- Applied Prisma schema successfully against the running database.

### Verification

- docker compose up -d → container running and Health=healthy.
- Prisma: `prisma db push` succeeded; Prisma Client generated.

### Notes

- No secrets committed. Local-only files: .env.local, .env.docker.
- Next steps proceed to Task 2 once human operator checks the box in Tasks.md (per docs/AGENTS.md).
