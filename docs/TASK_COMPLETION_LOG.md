# Task Completion Log

## Task: Audit and further breakdown Tasks.md

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished:

1. **Restructured Tasks.md with phase-based approach**
   - Created "Next 20 Tasks — Working Demo Track" section based on senior engineering feedback
   - Organized tasks into 4 clear phases with client verification at each step:
     - Phase 1: Foundation and Authentication (Tasks 1-6)
     - Phase 2: Core Chat Functionality with OpenAI (Tasks 7-11) 
     - Phase 3: Multi-Provider Support and Model Switching (Tasks 12-17)
     - Phase 4: Testing and Polish (Tasks 18-20)

2. **Removed inconsistencies and duplicates**
   - Removed duplicate "Environment Templates" task
   - Removed outdated "Feature Implementation — Tasks API" section (inconsistent with Next.js chat app)
   - Consolidated completed foundation tasks into reference section
   - Cleaned up redundant and old task content

3. **Enhanced task quality**
   - Added clear **Client Verification** criteria for each task
   - Made acceptance criteria more specific and testable
   - Ensured tasks align with PRD.md, Design.md, API.md, Database.md, and Providers.md
   - Added missing critical tasks (authentication setup, database seeding, provider-specific logic, context truncation, error handling)

4. **Improved task ordering**
   - Prioritized getting a single, end-to-end flow working first
   - Each phase delivers tangible, verifiable functionality
   - Dependencies clearly structured (auth before API integration, OpenAI before Anthropic, etc.)

### Key improvements based on senior engineering feedback:

- **Missing components addressed:** NextAuth.js setup, database seeding, provider-specific adapters, context truncation, API error handling
- **Granular breakdown:** Large tasks like "Replace Mocks with Real API Integration" were broken into specific, manageable steps
- **Clear verification:** Each task includes specific client verification criteria
- **Iterative progress:** Each phase builds upon the previous one with clear deliverables

### Verification:
- ✅ Next 20 tasks present as dedicated section near the top
- ✅ Each task has clear, testable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Duplicate "Environment Templates" task removed
- ✅ "Feature Implementation — Tasks API" section removed
- ✅ Tasks aligned with PRD.md and Design.md requirements
- ✅ Phase-based structure enables incremental client verification

### Next Task:
The first active task is now **Task 1: Setup local PostgreSQL using Docker** from Phase 1.

## Task: Setup local PostgreSQL using Docker

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Verified docker-compose.yml defines a PostgreSQL 15 service with healthcheck and persistent volume.
- Confirmed presence of .env.docker.example and used a local .env.docker (git-ignored) with:
  - POSTGRES_DB=bombay_dev
  - POSTGRES_USER=bombay
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=•••••••• (local dev only)
- Ensured .env.example includes a local Docker DATABASE_URL and docs/DEV.md documents Docker workflow.
- Brought the database up and confirmed health via Docker.
- Applied Prisma schema successfully against the running database.

### Verification

- docker compose up -d → container running and Health=healthy.
- Prisma: `prisma db push` succeeded; Prisma Client generated.

### Notes

- No secrets committed. Local-only files: .env.local, .env.docker.
- Checkbox in docs/Tasks.md marked in the same commit per updated AGENTS.md.

## Task: Extend Prisma schema for NextAuth

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Extended prisma/schema.prisma with NextAuth models: Account, Session, VerificationToken.
- Added relations from User → accounts and sessions.
- Ensured onDelete: Cascade on linking relations for cleanup consistency.

### Verification

- Ran `npx prisma migrate dev -n auth_models` against local Docker Postgres.
- Migration created and applied; Prisma Client generated successfully.
- Checkbox in docs/Tasks.md marked in the same commit.

### Notes

- No secrets committed; used local Docker database via .env.docker.
- Next task: Configure NextAuth with Google provider (route + adapter).

---

## Task: Configure NextAuth with Google provider

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Added NextAuth App Router handler at app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts.
- Created authOptions with Google provider and PrismaAdapter.
- Added lib/auth.ts helper exporting auth() and authOptions.
- Added lib/prisma.ts PrismaClient singleton.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds (type-checks and route compilation OK).
- Endpoints /api/auth/signin and /api/auth/signout are available when the dev server runs (no runtime secrets committed).

### Notes

- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit per updated AGENTS.md.
- Next task: Create protected route with user display.

---

## Task: Create protected route with user display

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Updated app/layout.tsx to render a header with Sign in/Sign out controls and show session.user.email when authenticated.
- Protected app/page.tsx: server-side check using auth(); redirects to NextAuth sign-in when unauthenticated.
- Controls are standard buttons/links with focus styles for keyboard accessibility.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- Sign-in link and sign-out form present; user email displays when authenticated (on running dev server).

### Notes

- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

## Task: Implement auth middleware for API routes

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Added lib/authz.ts with requireUser() utility and standard JSON error envelope helper.
- Protected /api/threads (GET, PATCH) and /api/messages (GET, POST) to return 401 when unauthenticated.
- Error envelope shape: { error: { code, message, details } }.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds; routes compile with the new guard.
- When dev server runs, unauthenticated requests receive 401 with standard envelope.

### Notes

- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

## Task: Database integration for user-specific threads

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Replaced fixtures in /api/threads with Prisma-backed GET and POST handlers.
- GET returns the authenticated user’s threads from Postgres (ordered by updatedAt desc).
- POST validates input via Zod and creates a thread for the current user (activeModel defaults to openai:gpt-4o when omitted).

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- With dev server running and a signed-in user, GET returns an empty list initially; POST creates a new thread row that persists.

### Notes

- Standard error envelope and authentication guard maintained.
- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

---

## Task: Messages API with database persistence

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- GET /api/messages now reads messages from Postgres for owned threads (ascending order).
- POST /api/messages persists a user message to the database before responding.
- Ownership checks enforce per-user isolation (403 on foreign threadId).

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- With dev server running and a signed-in user, GET returns DB-backed messages; POST creates a new user message row.
- Streaming remains a placeholder (SSE stub) pending Task 10.

### Notes

- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

---

## Task: OpenAI adapter implementation (non-streaming)

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Implemented provider interface and OpenAI adapter with chatNonStreaming and chatStreaming stubs.
- Added minimal provider registry (OpenAI mapped by model prefix).
- Added non-streaming validation path to POST /api/messages via `?mode=json` that calls adapter and returns assistant message JSON, without changing the UI SSE path.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds (adapter and registry compile).
- Non-streaming path reachable with a request to `/api/messages?mode=json` (returns stubbed content without OPENAI_API_KEY); DB persists assistant message.

### Notes

- UI continues to use SSE stub until Task 10.
- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.
