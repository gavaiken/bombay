# Task Completion Log

## Task: Audit and further breakdown Tasks.md

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished:

1. **Restructured Tasks.md with phase-based approach**
   - Created "Next 20 Tasks — Working Demo Track" section based on senior engineering feedback
   - Organized tasks into 4 clear phases with client verification at each step:
     - Phase 1: Foundation and Authentication (Tasks 1-6)
     - Phase 2: Core Chat Functionality with OpenAI (Tasks 7-11) 
     - Phase 3: Multi-Provider Support and Model Switching (Tasks 12-17)
     - Phase 4: Testing and Polish (Tasks 18-20)

2. **Removed inconsistencies and duplicates**
   - Removed duplicate "Environment Templates" task
   - Removed outdated "Feature Implementation — Tasks API" section (inconsistent with Next.js chat app)
   - Consolidated completed foundation tasks into reference section
   - Cleaned up redundant and old task content

3. **Enhanced task quality**
   - Added clear **Client Verification** criteria for each task
   - Made acceptance criteria more specific and testable
   - Ensured tasks align with PRD.md, Design.md, API.md, Database.md, and Providers.md
   - Added missing critical tasks (authentication setup, database seeding, provider-specific logic, context truncation, error handling)

4. **Improved task ordering**
   - Prioritized getting a single, end-to-end flow working first
   - Each phase delivers tangible, verifiable functionality
   - Dependencies clearly structured (auth before API integration, OpenAI before Anthropic, etc.)

### Key improvements based on senior engineering feedback:

- **Missing components addressed:** NextAuth.js setup, database seeding, provider-specific adapters, context truncation, API error handling
- **Granular breakdown:** Large tasks like "Replace Mocks with Real API Integration" were broken into specific, manageable steps
- **Clear verification:** Each task includes specific client verification criteria
- **Iterative progress:** Each phase builds upon the previous one with clear deliverables

### Verification:
- ✅ Next 20 tasks present as dedicated section near the top
- ✅ Each task has clear, testable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Duplicate "Environment Templates" task removed
- ✅ "Feature Implementation — Tasks API" section removed
- ✅ Tasks aligned with PRD.md and Design.md requirements
- ✅ Phase-based structure enables incremental client verification

### Next Task:
The first active task is now **Task 1: Setup local PostgreSQL using Docker** from Phase 1.

## Task: Implement auth middleware for API routes

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Added lib/authz.ts with requireUser() utility and standard JSON error envelope helper.
- Protected /api/threads (GET, PATCH) and /api/messages (GET, POST) to return 401 when unauthenticated.
- Error envelope shape: { error: { code, message, details } }.

### Verification

## Task: Database integration for user-specific threads

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Replaced fixtures in /api/threads with Prisma-backed GET and POST handlers.
- GET returns the authenticated user’s threads from Postgres (ordered by updatedAt desc).
- POST validates input via Zod and creates a thread for the current user (activeModel defaults to openai:gpt-4o when omitted).

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- With dev server running and a signed-in user, GET returns an empty list initially; POST creates a new thread row that persists.

### Notes

- Standard error envelope and authentication guard maintained.
- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

## Task: Messages API with database persistence

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- GET /api/messages now reads messages from Postgres for owned threads (ascending order).
- POST /api/messages persists a user message to the database before responding.
- Ownership checks enforce per-user isolation (403 on foreign threadId).

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- With dev server running and a signed-in user, GET returns DB-backed messages; POST creates a new user message row.
- Streaming remains a placeholder (SSE stub) pending Task 10.

### Notes

- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

---

## Task: OpenAI adapter implementation (non-streaming)

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Implemented provider interface and OpenAI adapter with chatNonStreaming and chatStreaming stubs.
- Added minimal provider registry (OpenAI mapped by model prefix).
- Added non-streaming validation path to POST /api/messages via `?mode=json` that calls adapter and returns assistant message JSON, without changing the UI SSE path.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds (adapter and registry compile).
- Non-streaming path reachable with a request to `/api/messages?mode=json` (returns stubbed content without OPENAI_API_KEY); DB persists assistant message.

### Notes

- UI continues to use SSE stub until Task 10.
- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

## Task: Database seeding for development

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Added prisma/seed.ts to create a dev user (SEED_USER_EMAIL), a sample thread, and two messages.
- Added npm script `db:seed` and configured Prisma seed runner via ts-node.
- Seed data aligns with DB schema and API expectations.

### Verification

- Ran `npx prisma db seed` against local Docker Postgres (DATABASE_URL from .env.docker) — seed completed.
- Verified rows exist with psql count queries for User, Thread, Message.

### Notes

- No secrets committed; local Docker DB used.
- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

## Task: Server-Sent Events streaming for OpenAI

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Implemented SSE in POST /api/messages backed by OpenAI adapter streaming.
- Persisted assistant message upon stream completion and emitted done event with usage shape.
- Kept non-streaming validation path (?mode=json) for Task 8.
- Introduced shared jsonError helper to standardize error envelopes.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- With no OPENAI_API_KEY, a deterministic stub stream is emitted; with a valid key, the adapter yields model output.

### Notes

- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

---

## Task: Anthropic adapter implementation

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Implemented Anthropic adapter with non-streaming and streaming utilities.
- Extended provider registry to recognize anthropic:* model IDs.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- With no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, deterministic stubs are returned/yielded.

### Notes

- Provider routing in endpoints will be wired in Task 13 (model switch UI + routing).

---

## Task: Provider routing and model switcher UI

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Converted PATCH /api/threads/:id to Prisma with auth and Zod validation; ensures only owner can update activeModel.
- UI header now displays the current model next to the title; model switcher remains in header.
- Ensured messages route already respects thread.activeModel for provider routing.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- Manually verified PATCH updates thread.activeModel in DB and UI model label updates.

### Notes

- Checkbox marked in docs/Tasks.md in the same commit.

## Task: Mid-conversation model switching

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Messages API now builds the full conversation history and passes it to the provider adapter.
- Added truncation utility (lib/context.ts) to maintain conservative token limits per model.
- Assistant messages are persisted with provider and model metadata.

### Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- Verified runtime behavior with stubbed adapters; history is constructed and truncated when large.

## Task: Context window truncation logic

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished

- Implemented buildPromptWithTruncation with conservative per-model limits and headroom.
- Added a unit test (Vitest) to verify truncation preserves the first system message and drops oldest turns.
