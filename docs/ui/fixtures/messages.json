I can give you specific refactoring suggestions. Even a simplified version would help me understand:\n\n- What the component does\n- How many lines of code\n- What makes it feel unwieldy\n- Any specific pain points\n\nAlternatively, you can describe the component's responsibilities and I'll suggest how to break it down.",
